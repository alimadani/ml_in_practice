# ml_in_practice

This repository is dedicated to the codes and data that have been (or will be) part of LinkedIn post series "machine learning in practice" that you can find me in my LinkedIn profile. Each post is about implementation of one (or more) machine learning methods on a dataset as well as assessing performance of the model quantitatively and/or visualising the results. The code will also include the information about the datasets, summary of the #machinelearning method as well as mathematical details of the performance measures. You can find codes and data of all of the posts in this repository.
